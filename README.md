# Creator_Demo

This project was created to enhance the presence of a content creator/streamer. Instead of using a simple website like Linktree 
the user could instead have a page like this. It would allow for more photos and creativity for all their basic information. <br>
<br>
The home page would look like this. It allows the viewer the chance to click on each section where the information will be revealed. <br>

Upon clicking on "Socials" the text is revealed. The background color changes for easier readability.<br>
