      <p>I started my streaming career March 2020. I had planned on this date even 
        before Covid hit. I started off streaming a lot of MLB The Show. I've since  
        transitionend into more variety of games and doing mostly MLB & WWE Watch-a-longs
      </p>
      <p>Bio</p>
      <p>I only do this part time as a hobby & side hustle. I've learned a lot of 
        skills while trying to improve my streams. I have custom alerts & layouts for 
        games and events. The emotes are made by me and the streamer Hyouoni.

      <p>I am a big goals guy. I do not intend to become a full time streamer. My goal is
        to reach 500 followers. I believe in quality of quantity. I don't make Youtube videos
        and I don't Tiktok. If you want to know me, hop into a stream and ask questions. I'm
        a pretty open book. 
      </p>
      <p>Mission</p>
      <p>I believe balance is important. I will still chase my adventures
        and hobbies. I still hang out with friends and loved ones. I'm also currently looking to make it
        as a front end web developer. All these things take timei and energy. Streaming is not #1 to me.</p>
